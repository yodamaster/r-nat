R-NAT (a high performance reverse NAT tool)

r-nat is created to allow services inside a private network be accessed from 
internet. By changing the client connection address, no other change is required.

Let me introduce how it works:
Host A: it can be a remote debugger, RDP service, FTP, or anything else(so far 
only TCP support is added), it listens at 0.0.0.0:4018. it is in somewhere in
this planet, inside a private network, can be one or more layers before it can 
reach internet. 
Host B: anyone wants to connect to above service, also inside a private network.

before r-nat was made, we may have to use vpn to connect them together, however,
it is sometimes not an option, say, no administrator right, or either of them may
 have been using openvpn.

after we have r-nat, it become very simple.
Host S with public ip: run r-nat-s, suppose the ip is: 1.1.1.1, it listens at
443. (443 is recommended)
Host A: run r-nat-c. it connects to 1.1.1.1:443, and according config file
registers a port 8018 in host S which will be routed to 127.0.0.1:4018, r-nat-s 
adds one more listen at 8018.
Host B: now can open VisualStudio as usual, type 1.1.1.1:8018, and start debugging 
program running on host A.

when a user connects to 1.1.1.1:8018, r-nat-s notifies r-nat-c someone connected,
r-nat-c creates a connection to 127.0.0.1:4018. The connection is established. 
Whenver the user or the local service sends data, r-nat will relay to the opposite.

It is built with asio,rapidxml, has been tested in ubuntu 16.04 lts, windows 7/8.1/10, 
debian 8(raspberry pi 3, orange pi zero)

TODO:
1. agent for host B so that we can avoid to expose more port in host S.
